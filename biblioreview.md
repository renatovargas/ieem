**Abstract:**

Indoor air pollution (IAP) caused by solid fuel use and/or traditional cooking stoves is a global health threat, particularly for women and young children. The WHO World Health Report 2002 estimates that IAP is responsible for 2.7% of the loss of disability adjusted life years (DALYs) worldwide and 3.7% in high- mortality developing countries. Despite the magnitude of this problem, social scientists have only recently begun to pay closer attention to this issue and to test strategies for reducing IAP. In this paper, we provide a survey of the current literature on the relationship between indoor air pollution, respiratory health and economic well-being. We then discuss the available evidence on the effectiveness of popular policy prescriptions to reduce IAP within the household.

**Quotes:**

"IAP may have long lasting effects on general health and well-being: early exposure to IAP during child- hood may stifle lung development, suggesting that the cost of this pollution may continue later in life. In fact, a growing literature indicates that environmental insults at early ages can have long lasting influences on human health and productivity (e.g., Almond, 2006)." (p. 1)


"In measuring the costs of indoor air pollution, it is important to look further than just the main effects on health. Imag- ine that an individual is in poor health. As such, he may not be able to conduct strenuous or sustained work. This limits his labor market opportunities and provides him with lower wages (if employed). Because the household exists in poverty, he cannot afford to pay for goods that could improve his health – better fuel, more nutritious foods, doctor’s visits – and would therefore improve his work ability. Thus, it be- comes a vicious cycle, where because members of the house- hold are both financially disadvantaged and in poor health, the household remains both in poverty and in poor health. In the economics literature, this is called a poverty trap (Das- gupta and Ray, 1986, 1987, 1990; Ray and Streufert, 1993; Ray, 1993)." (p. 4)


"However, other than these studies, there is very little evi- dence on the direct impact of air pollution on economic pro- ductivity. In fact, Bruce et al. (2000) explicitly state that much more evidence is needed on this point. On the other hand, there is a large medical literature linking iron supple- ments, which also improve respiratory functioning, to pro- ductivity (for example, see Davies et al., 1984; Hass and Brownlie, 2001; Zhu and Haas, 1998; Woodson et al., 1978)." (p.4)

"The most complete study to date on the impact of IAP on health is the RESPIRE study in Guatemala (described in Sect. 3). The RESPIRE study found significantly large impacts of the stoves on health. This study (Smith-Sivertsen et al., 2004 and Diaz et al., 2007) evaluated planchas, stoves that are large and cost about $64 to $110 (Alvarez et al., 2004)." (p. 6)

**Thoughts:**

Mentions RESPIRE study in Guatemala, but there are no definite numbers on the percentage productivity loss.

**Abstract:**

A comparison was made of the thermal efficiency and emissions of the traditional three-stone fire and the "Plancha" improved stove-burning wood. Simultaneous measurements of efficiency and emissions of suspended particles and carbon monoxide were taken in order to incorporate both of these factors into a single standard of performance - emissions per standard task. These factors were measured during both a Water Boiling Test (WBT) and a Standardized Cooking Test (SCT). No statistical difference in efficiency between the Plancha and traditional stove was found. The Plancha required more time to perform both of the tests, and this difference was statistically significant (p=0.048) for the WBT. The Plancha emitted 87% less suspended particles less than 2.5 nano-meter diameter (PM2.5) and 91% less CO per kJ of useful heat delivered compared to the open fire during the WBT. The relative environmental performance of the Plancha improved during the SCT, resulting in a 99% reduction of total suspended particulate matter(TSP) emissions and a 96% reduction of CO emissions per standardized cooking task. A strong correlation (r2= 0.87) was found between the average kitchen concentrations of CO and PM2.5 during the WBTs, indicating the usefulness of CO measurements as an inexpensive and accurate way of estimating PM2.5 concentrations. 


**Quotes:**

"The following study was carried out in the rural area of San Juan Ostuncalco, where respiratory infections accounted for 35% of general mortality and 48.1% of infant morbidity in 1990 (Hostnig 1991)." (p.739-740)

**Thoughts:**

Mentions that there are no fuel efficiency effects to the Plancha Mejorada stove. This is too old a study.

García-Frapolli et al., 2010. Beyond fuelwood savings: Valuing the economic bene ts of introducing improved biomass cookstoves in the Purépecha region of Mexico. "Ecological Economics".


Half of the world population relies on biomass for cooking, with very signi cant health as well as climate change impacts. Improved cookstoves have been disseminated as an alternative to reduce these impacts. However, few detailed studies about the economic bene ts of improved cookstoves (ICS) interventions, including environmental and health co-bene ts, exist to date. In this paper we perform a comprehensive economic evaluation of a dissemination program of ICS in rural Mexico. The resulting cost–bene t analysis (CBA) of the Patsari improved cookstove is presented, utilizing estimation of direct costs and bene ts, including fuelwood savings, income generation, health impacts, environmental conservation, and reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. The analysis is based on comprehensive data obtained through monitoring studies carried out in the Study Area from 2003 to the present. Results show that Patsari cookstoves represent a viable economic option for improving living conditions of the poorest inhabitants of rural Mexico, with bene t/cost ratios estimated between 11.4:1 and 9:1. The largest contributors to economic bene ts stemmed from fuelwood savings and reductions in health impacts, which constituted 53% and 28% of the overall bene t, respectively.
